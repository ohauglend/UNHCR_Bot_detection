"# UNHCR_Bot_detection" 

The purpose of this repository is to update the UNHCR with the progress made in the bot detection. 
The repository consists of the following folders:
•	Dataset
•	Model code
•	Implemented model

The Data folder contains only data files and data documentation, which are results of various steps in the model training process.

The Model code folder contains all code relevant for generating the model. This constitutes anything from pre-processing to model evaluation with documentation.

The Implemented model folder contains a ready to deploy model along with the required specifications. 

The repository will be updated before every UNHCR meeting.
